v1.5.3
----------------
Fix the View and Edit alter to work for other users in the group.
Was not not considering that file missing and file_object being null
This was a hotfix since it was leaving users unable to edit files other users where creating 
The hotfix was 54386a0b02c593ecccb48870ca09b0001e7474bd

v1.5.2.1

Hotfix:
Clone to Repo and Add to Repo was not using the current user id so it was not working for other users.
It now pulls in the current user to that list
